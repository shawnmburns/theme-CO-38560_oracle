This script was used to migrate all the assets from the client jars.  
The files were moved from /src/main/resources/clientconfig/clients/<CLIENT>/ei/assets in the client jar to <LOCALE>/<CLIENT>/theme in this git repository.

Needs to be run in bin directory.

USAGE:
    Migrate all clients with default locale en_us:
    ruby migrate.rb

    * NOTE - in the script there is an array @ignoreClients that contain the clients that are not en_us.  Any client in this array won't be copied over.

    Migrate single client to specified locale:
    ruby migrate.rb -c CLIENT -l LOCALE

    
OPTIONS:
    -c client to migrate
    -l locale of client
 
    -r remove the assets dir from <locale>/<client>.  Can be used with or without client specified.
